""""
Create a function named bitwise_or which takes two integers,
prints the integer values, then performs a bitwise OR (different to a boolean OR),
prints the result of the OR, then returns the result.

NOTE: We can't call this function 'or' because that name is reserved in Python so we call it bitwise_or instead.

Using code from the bitwise_and() function (see helper_functions.py), create an additional function called bitwise_or() which perform the bitwise OR operation (using the | character, also known as a pipe)
